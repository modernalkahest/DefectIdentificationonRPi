# Problem Statement
Structural integrity is crucial to any concrete structure built today from the smallest of homes to towering skyscrapers to underground metros to electrical routing pipes. Structural integrity is vital in these places. Often these structures are hard to reach and put the lives of daily wage workers at risk during maintenance.

This project aims to identify structural defects in mainly concrete to help mitigate risks to any concrete structures before any major damage is seen with little to no human intervention to reduce the maintenance risk of such structures.

We aim to achieve this through a vision-based deep-learning model on portable IoT devices like the Raspberry Pi. So without further delay let us dive into the results of the survey.

# Proposed Solution
YOLOv11 small model with image segmentation running on a Raspberry Pi 5 to make a portable solution that would reach such hard-to-reach places and still provide accurate maintenance reports without endangering the lives of daily wage workers or at least minimising the risk.
